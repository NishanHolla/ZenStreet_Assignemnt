* **Node addition:** Users can add new nodes to the tree by clicking on an existing node or the root.
* **Node deletion:** Users can delete nodes by clicking on the "delete" button associated with each node.
* **Save changes:** Users can save their changes to the tree structure for later use.

**Technologies used**

* Vite.js
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* CSS
* [Additional libraries or frameworks used, if any]
