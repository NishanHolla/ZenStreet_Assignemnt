## Tree Data Visualization

**Overview**

This project is a tree data visualization application built using Vite.js. It allows users to interact with the tree structure by adding, deleting, and saving nodes.

**Features**

* **Interactive tree visualization:** Users can expand, collapse, and drag nodes to reorganize the tree structure.
* **Node addition:** Users can add new nodes to the tree by clicking on an existing node or the root.
* **Node deletion:** Users can delete nodes by clicking on the "delete" button associated with each node.
* **Save changes:** Users can save their changes to the tree structure for later use.

**Technologies used**

* Vite.js
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* CSS
* [Additional libraries or frameworks used, if any]
